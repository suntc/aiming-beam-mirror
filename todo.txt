# redirect segmentation on button click # to be tested in lab
# look for instrument and avoid segmentation
# identify frame grabbers by id # to be tested in simsuite. Need to make sure that we still run at full fps - modified class that deals with frame grabber connection. Still missing serial number from FGs
# set USB camera resolution automatically # to be tested in lab
# clear lifetime values after segmentation
# USB cameras not working well without frame grabber
# firefly setter # missing LabVIEW implementation
# image white light overlay setter # missing LabVIEW implementation
